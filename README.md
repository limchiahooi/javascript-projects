# JavaScript Projects
This repo contains my JavaScript projects as part of the Next Academy's Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp. More projects will be added soon.

## 1. Dynamic Image Gallery with Lightbox
This project is about building an image gallery with lightbox. When the user clicks on a thumbnail of an image, a larger size of the image will pop up in a lightbox style. This project draws inspiration from the popular JavaScript Library by [Lokesh Dhakar](https://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/). But this project is about building the image gallery with lightbox from scratch using plain JavaScript. 

Folder name: `lightbox`

## 2. Word Guessing Game
This project is about building a word guessing game similar to [Hangman](http://www.playhangman.com). The game will have a word that the player has to guess by entering the alphabet one by one. The player has a limited number of guesses, if he/she can correctly guess all the alphabets before using up all the guesses then he/win wins!
